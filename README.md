## General Notes

## JS
+ Closure: a `function` created within `a function`. Variables belong to the closure that they were created in.

## CSS

## HTML

## Linked Lists
+ Traversing, Inserting, Deleting
+ Always test for the end of a linked list while traversing
+ Deletion and insertion require a pointer or reference to the element immediately preceding the deletion or insertion location.
+ Having the list size available makes it easy to solve the mth-from-the-end problem
+ Cycle testing can be implemented using two pointers at different speeds

## Trees / Graphs
+ Tree often means a binary tree
+ Lookup is an `O(log(n))` operation in a balanced BST
